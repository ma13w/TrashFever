### WASTE SORTING 
------


The game is really simple, it consists in dividing different types of trash in the right garbage can, without making any error. All those things need to be done in a certain time. 

In the other game you must select the right answer 

The goal of the videogame is doing the best score without throwing the trash in a wrong garbage can and guessing the right answer. Another target of this game is learning waste sorting in a funny way. 

At a certain point of the game, when you don’t do any error for a long time, hole will appear. The hole will absorb all the type of trash so you don’t have to choose the right trash can, so you can make easy points. 

To make this videogame we used JavaScript. It’s a very common language that is used not only for videogames like this but also for more difficult codes. With CSS and HTML, it’s one of the main technologies to program web pages. And for the other game we used C, another common language that we learned at school. 

When you play the game, you can see a stone wall, with a green tube. The trashes comes out from the tube, and on the right and on the left of the tube some trash can will appear. When you got a high score some new type of trash and new trash can will appear like glass and metals
